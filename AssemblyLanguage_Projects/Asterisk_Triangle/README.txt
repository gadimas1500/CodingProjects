Lab 3: ASCII-risks (Asterisks)

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, we were introduced to assembly language using MIPS and MARS. THis program prints different ASCII triangles along with
their height depending on the input from the user. We also incorporated many syscalls to print, get user input, and exit the 
running program.

INSTRUCTIONS

This program is intended to run using MARS software in assembly language. When prompted, the user is to enter an integer number
greater than zero. If a number less than or equal to zero in inputed, then the user will get an invalid message and be prompted to
input another response until the condition is met. 

When the user inputs an accepted value, the program will create a triangle out of asterisks the height of the user's input. 

The program exits when the triangle is printed to the screen.
